# My personal website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website and portfolio. This site is designed to be a professional showcase of my work in the field of computer science, including software engineering and data science projects. It's a living, evolving testament to my progress as a developer, reflecting my passion, skills, and commitment to ongoing learning.

## Technologies Used
This website is built using Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll creates a fast, secure and easy-to-use website that's perfectly suited for personal projects and portfolios. The site is styled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which integrates seamlessly with Jekyll and allows for easy deployment and version control.

## Future Enhancements
I'm always learning and looking to improve my skills. Therefore, I intend to continuously update this website with new projects, blog posts, and features as I explore more areas of computer science.

Please feel free to browse through my work and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to collaborate.
